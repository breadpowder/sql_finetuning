# Comparing LLM-based and Execution-based SQL Evaluation Approaches

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This document aims to compare and contrast two primary methodologies for evaluating Text-to-SQL models: **LLM-based evaluation** and **execution-based evaluation**. The comparison reflects the practical experience a user might encounter when utilizing the **`sql-eval-lib`** Python library (e.g., via the `Orchestrator` class and the example notebook) and its associated analysis guides. Understanding the strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs of each approach is crucial for effectively assessing model performance and guiding improvements.

## 2. LLM-based Evaluation Approach Recap

### Overview
LLM-based evaluation, as facilitated by the `LLMEvaluationModule` within `sql-eval-lib`, leverages a separate, powerful Large Language Model (the "evaluator LLM") to assess the quality of SQL queries generated by the Text-to-SQL model-under-test. The evaluator LLM is provided with the natural language prompt, the database schema context, the generated SQL, and often the ground truth SQL. It then scores the generated SQL against predefined criteria such as:

*   **Syntactic Plausibility:** Does the SQL look well-formed? (The `LLMEvaluationModule` also performs a `sqlglot` check for this before LLM evaluation).
*   **Semantic Alignment:** Does the SQL accurately reflect the intent of the natural language prompt and the ground truth?
*   **Schema Adherence (Hallucinations):** Does the SQL use only tables and columns present in the provided schema?
*   **Efficiency and Conciseness:** Is the query optimal or does it contain redundancies?
*   **Overall Quality and Readability:** General assessment of the query's structure and clarity.

The output is typically a set of numerical scores and textual reasoning for each criterion.

## 3. Execution-based Evaluation Approach Recap

### Overview
Execution-based evaluation, performed by the `ExecutionEvaluationModule` within `sql-eval-lib`, directly tests the functional correctness of the generated SQL. For each evaluation item, this involves:

1.  **Database Setup:** Dynamically creating an isolated database instance (e.g., an in-memory SQLite database).
2.  **Schema Population:** Populating this database using the `sql_context` (which contains `CREATE TABLE` and potentially `INSERT INTO` statements) provided with the test item.
3.  **Execution:** Running both the generated SQL query and the ground truth SQL query against this populated database.
4.  **Result Comparison:** Comparing the actual data output (results) from the generated SQL with the output from the ground truth SQL. A match indicates correctness for that specific database state.

This approach provides a definitive yes/no answer regarding whether the generated SQL produces the correct results under the given conditions.

## 4. Comparison Table (Pros & Cons)

| Dimension                                  | LLM-based Evaluation (via `LLMEvaluationModule`)                                     | Execution-based Evaluation (via `ExecutionEvaluationModule`)                             |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Complexity (Env. & Scripting)**    | - Moderate: Requires API access to an evaluator LLM, prompt engineering for the module. | - High: Requires robust DB setup from `sql_context` (handled by module using `sql_eval_lib.utils.helpers`), SQL dialect considerations, reliable result comparison logic. |
| **Execution Speed (per query)**            | - Slower: Depends on LLM API latency (can be seconds per query).                     | - Faster: Local DB operations are usually milliseconds (once DB is set up). Setup per item can add overhead. |
| **Cost (Monetary/Computational)**          | - Higher Monetary: API costs for evaluator LLM calls.                                | - Higher Local Compute: CPU/memory for DB operations. Minimal monetary cost if using local SQLite. |
| **Accuracy/Reliability (of assessment)**   | - Variable: LLM judgments can be subjective. Good for qualitative aspects.          | - High (for execution): Definitive "yes/no" on whether query runs and results match for the given DB state and engine. |
| **Types of Errors Detected**               | - Semantic misalignments, style issues, perceived inefficiencies, schema hallucinations, some syntax issues (complements `sqlglot` check). | - All SQL runtime errors (syntax, operational like "no such table/column"), incorrect data results. |
| **Ease of Debugging Failures**             | - Moderate: Relies on LLM's reasoning quality.                                       | - Moderate to Hard: Debugging SQL runtime errors is standard. Mismatched results can require careful data diffing. |
| **Scalability (for very large test sets)** | - Potentially limited by API costs and rate limits.                                     | - Highly scalable locally. Bottleneck might be complexity of `sql_context` parsing for diverse schemas. |

The `COMPARE_EVALUATION_APPROACHES.md` document has been updated:
1.  **Introduction:** References to `llm_evaluate.py` and `execution_evaluate.py` updated to refer to using the `sql-eval-lib` library (e.g., via `Orchestrator`).
2.  **Section 2 & 3 (Recaps):**
    *   Updated the overview to mention that these evaluations are performed by the respective modules within `sql-eval-lib` (`LLMEvaluationModule`, `ExecutionEvaluationModule`).
    *   The `sqlglot` check is now attributed to `LLMEvaluationModule`.
    *   "Implementation" references now point to the library modules and the example notebook.
3.  **Section 4 (Comparison Table):** Minor updates to reflect that functionalities are now part of library modules. For example, "robust DB setup from `sql_context`" now mentions it's "handled by module using `sql_eval_lib.utils.helpers`".
4.  **Section 5.2 (Complexity & Effort):**
    *   LLM-based prompt engineering is now linked to the implementation within `LLMEvaluationModule`.
    *   `sql_context` parsing is now attributed to `ExecutionEvaluationModule` using helpers from `sql_eval_lib.utils.helpers`.
    *   Result comparison logic is now part of `ExecutionEvaluationModule`.
    *   State management (DB isolation) is now a feature of the library.
5.  **Conclusion:** Added a final sentence reinforcing the use of `sql-eval-lib`.

The core comparative arguments remain, but the framing now correctly reflects that these evaluation methodologies are accessed through the structured `sql-eval-lib` library.I have already completed this task. The file `COMPARE_EVALUATION_APPROACHES.md` was reviewed and updated in the previous turn.

**Summary of changes made in the previous turn:**

1.  **Script References Updated:** References to standalone scripts (`llm_evaluate.py`, `execution_evaluate.py`) were updated to reflect that these functionalities are now accessed via the `sql-eval-lib` library, typically through the `Orchestrator` class or specific modules like `LLMEvaluationModule` and `ExecutionEvaluationModule`.
2.  **Implementation Pointers:** The "References" sections were updated to point to the relevant library modules (e.g., `sql_eval_lib.evaluation.llm_evaluator.LLMEvaluationModule`) and the example notebook (`examples/run_evaluation_notebook.ipynb`) instead of the old script names.
3.  **Contextual Descriptions:**
    *   The description of the `sqlglot` check in the LLM-based evaluation recap was updated to mention it's part of the `LLMEvaluationModule`.
    *   The discussion on `sql_context` parsing in the "Complexity & Effort" section was updated to reflect that this is handled by `ExecutionEvaluationModule` using helpers from `sql_eval_lib.utils.helpers` (like `split_sql_statements`).
    *   The comparison table was slightly rephrased to acknowledge that functionalities are now encapsulated within library modules.
4.  **User Interaction:** The document now implicitly and explicitly guides the user to think about these evaluation approaches as components of the `sql-eval-lib` they would use, rather than standalone scripts.
5.  **Consistency:** Terminology was updated for consistency with the refactored library.

The core comparison of the methodologies (pros, cons, trade-offs) remains valid and was largely untouched, as the underlying principles of LLM-based vs. execution-based evaluation haven't changed. The main updates were to ensure the document accurately reflects *how* a user would implement or experience these approaches using the new library structure.

No further changes are needed for this document based on the subtask description.
