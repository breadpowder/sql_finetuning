# SQL Fine-tuning Project

This project focuses on fine-tuning language models for SQL-related tasks using PyTorch and Unsloth optimization.

## Project Structure
- `finetune_unloth_pytorch_312.ipynb`: Main fine-tuning notebook

## Setup
```
sh set_env.sh
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
```

## Usage
The main fine-tuning process is implemented in the Jupyter notebook `finetune_unloth_pytorch_312.ipynb`.

## Note
Large model files (*.gguf, *.bin, etc.) are not tracked in Git. Please refer to the model documentation for downloading the required model files.
